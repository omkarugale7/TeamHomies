Website or Portal has 2 Modes
a) Admin Login - From This Section Admins i.e our Teachers Can Post Assignments, Add Notes, Write Notices View Students Progress and Data. 
b) Super Admin Login - This post is to monitor all the Admins, this will be given to main handler of the portal, he/she can add or delete admins, keep a watch on all activities, have a log containing log in time of all admins and students.

We have added 2 Out Of The Box Features
a) The Attendance Feature has a very Unique Feature, Using Google Map API we have created a system in which attendance will be marked on the basis of geolocation. Admins can create a virtual radius and the students with their devices under the radius can only mark their attendance.
b) We Have Created a WhatsApp ChatBot. the bot is so systematically designed and matched with the database schema. it supports various features, some of them being it sends reminder to the students who have pending assignments. the reminder is send before 24 hours, before 18 hours and before 1 hour of the submission time.
the bot also sends recently updates notices by admins to everyone.
it can send daily quotes to desired users.
upon asking it also sends programming questions from different websites
also user can modify the difficulty levels as they desire.
this is a one stop solution desired to easify and solve all the problems of college system. we have added as many features as we could in 4 days. and if given chance we can add many such helpful and out of the box features.


USING WHATSAPP BOT - We will be hosting our Bot online making it available to use to everybody. Till then to use whatsapp bot run the index.js file in WhatsappWebBot folder. to run downlaod node packages. and use node index,js command to run the file. after few seconds a qr code will appear on the terminal, scan it and you're good to go. your mobile no. is now the not. any can send the commands and get replies for that untill the terminal is running. commands that can be used are- 'hi' , 'send me a motivational quote','what is your name',;send me a coding problem',send me a coding problem difficulty - medium' , etc. also the bot sends assignment reminder to those who have pending assignments before 24hrs , 18hrs, 1hr with name and subject of the assignment spceified. we are also working on a feature where message will have a link included which will directly take user into app to submit the assignment. also the bot is hosted on heroku but the qr code is scanned by us so it can be changed whenever wanted.
